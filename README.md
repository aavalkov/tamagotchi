#Tomagotchi
This application uses JS OO and initialization to create a tamagotchi like game. Users are prompted to enter in the name of their Tamagotchi and then a timer will start that counts down food, sleep, and activity levels. If the user doesn't click on the button to raise the levels, the Tamagotchi will die.
